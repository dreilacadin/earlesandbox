First in our list is the very picturesque Nyhavn. This port is a famous tourist spot as it features the colorful townhouses along the canal. In this area, it is highly suggested that you take the canal tour. You will ride a boat that will take you around and a tour guide will explain the spots that you will see along the way, such as the house where Hans Christian Andersen used to live, The Opera, Amalienborg Palace, The Old Stock Exchange, Christianshavn, Our Saviours Church, The Sixtus Battery, The Black Diamond, ‘BLOX’, and of course, the Little Mermaid.
